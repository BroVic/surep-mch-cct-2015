Bits and pieces from a survey our team carried out on SURE-P MCH Conditional Cash Transfer Pilot Scheme in May 2015

First of all, I'm not too sure what I'm doing at this stage, except I can see how powerful a tool this environment can be for making the most of the work put into this data analysis.

Our company, Global Health and Medical Consultants Ltd., based in Abuja, Nigeria, was commissioned by the government and the United Nations Population Fund to carry out an assessment of a pilot scheme for the Subsidy Reinvestment Programme Maternal and Child Health Project (SURE-P MCH) which was piloting a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) scheme in 10 locations in Nigeria.

This repository will contain data from that survey as well as code used for the analysis, which was carried out using the R Programming language. Interestingly, I had only just learnt a bit of how to use R shortly before we were saddled with the project and told the funders that we would be using it for the analysis. Having learnt a bit (or a lot) more about the language and since I have the right to use both the data and the code as I please, I decided to present it here and keep on developing it whilst at the same time understanding how to use these great tools that I've been missing out from in the past.

I can be contacted for comments at orduv@ghmcl.com.
